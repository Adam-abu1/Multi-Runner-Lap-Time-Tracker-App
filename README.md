#Multi Runner Lap Time Tracker App

----

##Not yet completed due to:
- Functionality to add runners is incomplete
- Styling not yet finished
- Responsiveness of the application can be improved


##What needs to be done:
- Unable to add runner due to unecessary properties needing to be defined upon instantiation of runners
- DocBlocks on every method should be added
- Start button should be disabled if no runners are in the race
- Add runner button should only be enabled when a value can be picked out of the text input.
- updateDetails method under the application class can be refactored to be easier to read

##Alternative Idea
- Use Vue js + Nuxt.js to build application using the framework then statically generate the content
- Vue js would allow for it to be easier to implement the table rows and hold data
